# vad-tflite
This project builds a model architecture based on tf and converts the trained model in tf format to tflite format for easy deployment on mobile and embedded devices. At the same time, the project provides complete code for data processing, training, model format conversion, inference, etc., and demonstrates the effect through gradio.
